# its timeout against a listener that does not answer) and WSAConnectByList
# (past a closed port), cancels GetAddrInfoExW lookups and lets their
# timeout end them, and installs, disables, reorders and removes a name
# space provider, a service class, an application category and a transport
# provider record, with WSAProviderConfigChange completing on the change.
# These were stubs: success with nothing done, or failure.
