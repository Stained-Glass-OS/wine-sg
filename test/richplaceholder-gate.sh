# RichEdit's placeholder text (patches/sg/1511), under Xvfb:
# test/richplaceholder-probe.c sets a RichEdit's placeholder as Office's
# React Native text boxes do (EM_SETTEXTEX with ST_PLACEHOLDERTEXT). Word's
# start screen box ("Describe the document you'd like to write") got it
# inserted as text: typing went after it (David's QA, 2026-10-07).
#
#  - the placeholder is not the control's text (its length stays 0);
#  - it is shown, greyed, while the control is empty, and again when it is
#    emptied;
#  - a typed character replaces it.
